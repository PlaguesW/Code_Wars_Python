# DESCRIPTION:
#
# I'm new to coding and now I want to get the sum of two arrays... Actually the sum of all their elements.
# I'll appreciate for your help.
#
# P.S. Each array includes only integer numbers. Output is a number too.

def array_plus_array(arr1, arr2):
    a = sum(arr1);
    b = sum(arr2);
    return a + b
